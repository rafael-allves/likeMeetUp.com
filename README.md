# Building a "clone" of the MeetUp.com

this is a simple project with the intuite to learn laravel php framework!
In mosts commits u'll se something like a test of an attribute working!

### caution!
If u're not familiar with backend development and by some reason are seeing this repo please note that read about connection and sensible data with .env (dotenv)

## techonologies
<p styles= ""color: #f2a340;"">
    PHP Laravel 
     HTML  
     CSS  
     BootStrap CSS 
     ION-ICONS 
     Vanilla JS 
</p>

The HTML, CSS, JS aren't the main focus here! So this project design is simple and at this point has'nt responsive model and has just a large CSS page to every page link it but i'm proud to myself because the focus is backend development and i CAN DO IT !!!

### i'm actualy enjoying the proccess!
